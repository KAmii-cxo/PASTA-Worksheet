The example of PASTA worksheet [portfolio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1veVZ-u3GW_JUSM8Rpfn8s6ZYaOeKx-QK?usp=drive_link)
## Overview

PASTA is a risk-based threat modeling methodology that helps identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

## Key Features

- **Focus on attack simulation**
- **Risk-centric approach**
- **Supports the identification and analysis of threats through structured steps**

## The 7 Phases of PASTA

Each phase of the PASTA model provides specific insights into the threat landscape of an application/system.

### Phase 1: Define the Objectives (Define Security Requirements)

**Goal**:  
- Understand the business objectives, security requirements, and risk tolerance of the system or organization.

**Action**:  
- Engage stakeholders, gather information about the system's architecture, and define the security needs.

**Example**:  
- Define compliance, confidentiality, availability, and integrity requirements for an online banking system.

---

### Phase 2: Define the Technical Scope

**Goal**:  
- Establish the technical boundaries of the system to identify assets, technology stacks, and points of potential weakness.

**Action**:  
- Identify the attack surface, network topology, and system components (e.g., web servers, APIs).

**Example**:  
- List technologies used in the app, such as databases, authentication methods, and third-party integrations.

---

### Phase 3: Application Decomposition

**Goal**:  
- Break down the application into smaller components to understand its functionality and identify critical parts that may be targets for attackers.

**Action**:  
- Decompose the application into modules and analyze data flow between components.

**Example**:  
- Break down an e-commerce platform into sections such as user management, payment processing, and inventory control.

---

### Phase 4: Threat Analysis

**Goal**:  
- Identify potential threats to the system from external and internal sources.

**Action**:  
- Use threat intelligence and simulate attack scenarios based on known vulnerabilities and tactics.

**Example**:  
- Identify the risk of SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) in web applications.

---

### Phase 5: Vulnerability Analysis

**Goal**:  
- Assess the vulnerabilities associated with the identified threats.

**Action**:  
- Perform vulnerability assessments, identify weaknesses in the application, and evaluate potential exploitability.

**Example**:  
- Use automated scanning tools like OWASP ZAP to identify common vulnerabilities like cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

---

### Phase 6: Attack Simulation

**Goal**:  
- Simulate real-world attacks to assess the effectiveness of current security measures.

**Action**:  
- Execute controlled attacks to test the system’s defense mechanisms, including penetration testing and social engineering.

**Example**:  
- Simulate a phishing attack or SQL injection to check the system’s response and logging capabilities.

---

### Phase 7: Risk and Impact Analysis

**Goal**:  
- Analyze the risk and impact of the identified threats and vulnerabilities.

**Action**:  
- Evaluate the potential impact on business operations and determine risk mitigation strategies.

**Example**:  
- Assess the financial and reputational damage of a data breach involving customer payment details.

---

## Best Practices in Implementing PASTA

- **Collaboration**: Involve cross-functional teams (security, developers, business owners) in each phase to gather diverse perspectives.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Continuously integrate threat intelligence to stay updated on emerging attack trends and tactics.
- **Automate**: Leverage automated tools to facilitate the threat and vulnerability identification process.
- **Continuous Testing**: Conduct frequent attack simulations to adapt to evolving attack methods.

---

## PASTA Use Cases

### Example 1: E-commerce Platform
- An e-commerce platform uses PASTA to identify threats such as account takeovers or unauthorized payment processing and mitigate risks by implementing multi-factor authentication and encryption.

### Example 2: Financial Institution
- A financial institution applies PASTA to assess potential threats like insider attacks or financial fraud, leading to the deployment of advanced monitoring and alerting systems.

---

## Conclusion

**Summary**:  
The PASTA methodology is a comprehensive framework for threat modeling that helps organizations identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited. It’s a structured, risk-based approach that involves attack simulation and continuous improvement of security postures.
